Have you ever wished you had hand soap inspired by a songstress? Or maybe a moody-looking notebook to scribble some angst in? Get excited because this shop is something of an Extraordinary Machine!

## Technologies

Fiona Apple Store was created using Node.js, MySQL2, Sequelize, dotenv, JavaScript, and Insomnia.

## Resources Used

More insight into design web services using the REST paradigm:

I found a trove of code snippets using sequelize here:

This article helped me understand dotenv more clearly.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I would like to add descriptions to the seeded products.

I think that this would be a fun store to design so I would enjoy revisiting that side of this project too.

## Learn More

In 2019, Fiona Apple pledged two years of royalties from her song "Criminal" to the organization "While They Wait". The group seeks to raise awareness and change laws to end mass incarceration and assist families going through the immigration process.  

The portraits listed in the "Art" category of this store are featured in the "Stories" section in the website below.
